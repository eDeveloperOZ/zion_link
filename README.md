## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Flutter: Ensure you have Flutter installed on your system. The project is built with Flutter, so you need to have Flutter SDK installed. For installation instructions, visit the [Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- Dart: Since Flutter uses Dart, make sure you have Dart installed. It usually comes with the Flutter SDK.
- An IDE: You will need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports Flutter. We recommend using vsCode with the Flutter and Dart plugins. You can also use Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA.

### Installation

To install Zion Link and set it up for development, follow these detailed steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the Zion Link repository to your local machine. Open a terminal and run the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:eDeveloperOZ/zion_link.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: After cloning, move into the Zion Link project directory by running:
   ```bash
   cd ZionLink
   ```

3. **Install Flutter**: If you haven't already installed Flutter, follow the instructions on the [Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to set it up on your system. Ensure you also install the Dart SDK, which is included with Flutter.

4. **Set Up Your IDE**: Install your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) if you haven't already. We recommend Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, or IntelliJ IDEA for Flutter development. Make sure to install the Flutter and Dart plugins/extensions for your IDE to get full support for Flutter development.

5. **Get Dependencies**: Open your terminal or command prompt within the project directory, and run the following command to fetch all the necessary Flutter dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

6. **Open the Project in Your IDE**: Launch your IDE and open the Zion Link project folder you have cloned to your machine.

7. **Run the Project**: Finally, start the project by running:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
   Make sure you have an emulator running or a device connected to your computer. This command compiles the Dart code into a native app and installs it on your emulator/device.

By following these steps, you should have Zion Link installed and running on your development machine. For further assistance, refer to the Flutter documentation or the project's FAQ section.
